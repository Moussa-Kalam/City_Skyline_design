# Building a City Skyline
In this project, I will build a city skyline. 

At the end of this project, the goal is to learn how to configure CSS variables so I can reuse them whenever I want.

When the document size is 1000px wide or less, the image display is night mode. Try it out ;)

Here is a preview of the final products
